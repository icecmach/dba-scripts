Automating Database Startup and Shutdown on Linux

1 - Once the instance is created, edit the "/etc/oratab" file setting the restart flag for each instance to 'Y'

ORCL:/u01/app/oracle/product/19.3.0/dbhome_1:Y

2 - Create and give permissions to the scripts in /home/oracle/scripts

chown -R oracle.oinstall /home/oracle/scripts
chmod u+x /home/oracle/scripts/*.sh

3 - Create a file called "/etc/systemd/system/dbora.service" as the root user

4 - Reload systemd to enable the service

# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl enable dbora.service

5 - You can test them using the following command as the "root" user.

# systemctl start dbora.service
# systemctl stop dbora.service
# systemctl status dbora.service
